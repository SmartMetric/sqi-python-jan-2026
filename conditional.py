# Exercise 4
# An airport boarding system:
# The user enters boarding pass ("yes"/"no") and passport ("yes"/"no").
# - If both are "yes", print "Proceed to boarding".
# - If boarding pass is missing, print "No boarding pass".
# - If passport is missing, print "No passport".
# - If both missing, print "Denied entry".

# boarding_pass = input("boarding pass?  : "    ).lower()
# passport = input("passport?  :"    ).lower()
# if boarding_pass == "yes" and passport == "yes":
#     print("Proceed to boarding")
# elif boarding_pass =="no":
#     print("No boarding pass")    
# elif passport == "no":
#     print("No passport")
# elif boarding_pass == "no" and passport == "no":
#     print("Denied entry")







#
# Example input/output executions:
#
# Boarding pass? no
# Passport? yes
# Output: No boarding pass
#
# Boarding pass? yes
# Passport? no
# Output: No passport
#
# Boarding pass? no
# Passport? no
# Output: Denied entry
#
# Boarding pass? yes
# Passport? yes
# Output: Proceed to boarding
#
# Boarding pass? no
# Passport? yes
# Output: No boarding pass




# Collect two numbers as input from the user and assign as variables, a and b, write an if 
# statement that prints "a and b are both positive" if both a and b are positive, prints 
# "Only one is positive" if one of them is positive, and prints "Neither is positive" if 
# neither is positive.

# a = int(input("Enter the first number ?"))
# b = int(input("Enter second number ?"))
# if a > 0 and b > 0:
#       print("a and b are both positive")
# if a > 0 or b > 0:
#      print("Only one is positive")
# elif a < 0 and b < 0:
#      print("Neither is positive")

# # Collect three numbers x, y and z as a comma separated string input from the user and 
# # print "Increasing order" if they are in STRICTLY increasing order, "Decreasing order" 
# # if they are in STRICTLY decreasing order, and "Neither" otherwise.
# x = int(input("Enter the first number  : "))

#     print("Decreasing order")
# else:

# Write a program that reads a string called `palindrome` supplied through user input and checks if it is a palindrome. 
# Print "Is a palindrome" if it is, otherwise print "Not a palindrome".

# word = input("enter a word    :").replace().lower()
# if word == word[::-1]:
#     print("Is a palindrome    :")
# else:
#     print("Not a palindrome")




# You have three variables: x, y, and z collected as 3 separate inputs from the user. 
# Write an if statement that checks if exactly two out of the three variables are equal and prints "Two are equal" 
# if this is true. Otherwise, print "All different" or "All same" accordingly.

# x = int(input("Enter the first number ?"))
# y= int(input("Enter the second number ?"))
# z = int(input("Enter the third number ?"))

# elif x == y or y == z or x == z:
#     print( "Two are equal")
# else:
#     print("All are different")



# Given three angles angle1, angle2, and angle3 collected as 3 separate inputs from the user, 
# use if statements to check if they can form a valid triangle. 
# Print "Valid triangle" if the sum of the angles is 180 degrees and all angles are greater than 0. 
# Otherwise, print "Invalid triangle".
# angle1 = int(input("enter first angle :   "))
# angle2 = int(input("enter second angle :   "))
# angle3 = int(input("enter third angle :   "))

#     print("Valid triangle")
# else:
#     print("Invalid triangle")


# You have a single character variable `ch` supplied through user input. 
# Write an if statement that prints "Vowel" if ch is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, both uppercase and lowercase), 
# and "Consonant" otherwise. Assume that the input is a single alphabet character.
# vowel = ("a, e, i, o, u")
# consonant = not vowel

# import string

# string.ascii_lowercase

# # input("enter an alphabet" )

# # if 






# Given a comma separated string input from the user of three colors color1, color2, and color3,
#  write an if statement to check if all three colors are primary colors (red, blue, yellow). 
# Print "All primary colors" if they are, otherwise print "Not all primary colors".

# color1 = input("Enter the first color")
# color2 = input("Enter the second color")

# if color1 in primary_colors and color2 in primary_colors and color3 in primary_colors:
#     print("All primary colors")
# else:
#     print("Not all primary colors")




# You have a variable `mode` supplied by the user which can be "manual", "automatic", or "off". 
# Write an if statement that prints "Manual mode activated" if mode is "manual", "Automatic mode activated"
#  if mode is "automatic", and "System is off" if mode is "off".

# mode = input("Enter mode   :").lower()
# if mode == "manual":

# elif mode == "automatic":
#     print("Automatic mode activated")
# elif mode == "off":
#     print("System is off")
# else:
#     print("Invalid")



# Given a string `message` entered by the user, use if statements to check if the message contains any of the words 
# "urgent", "important", or "immediate". If it contains any of these words, print "High priority message". 
# Otherwise, print "Normal message".

# message = input("enter a word   :").lower()
# if "urgent "in message or "important"in message or "immediate" in message:
#     print("High priority message")
# else:
#     print("Normal message")  

#  10.	You have two variables, status1 and status2, provided through user input, each of 
# 	which can be "active", “inactive", or "pending". Write an if statement to print 
# 	"Both active" if both statuses are "active", "One active" if exactly one is "active",
# 	and "None active" if neither is "active".
# status1 = input("enter the first status   :").lower()
# status2 = input("enter the second status   :").lower()

# both_active = status1 == "active" and status2 == "active"
# one_active = status1 == "active" or status2 == "active"
# none_active = status1 != "active" and status2 != "active"

# if both_active:
#     print("Both active")
# elif one_active:
#     print("One active")
# elif none_active:
#     print("None active")

#  11. 	Given a string `filename` supplied by the user, write an if statement to check if the
# 	filename ends with “.jpg", ".png", or ".gif". Print "Image file" if it does, otherwise
# 	print "Not an image file".
# file_namme = input("enter your file name  :").strip().lower()

# if file_namme.endswith(("jpg","png","gif" )):
#     print("Image file")
# else:
#     print("Not an image file")


#  12. 	You have a variable `access_level` provided through user input which can be "admin",
# 	"user", or "guest". Write an if statement that prints "Full access" if access_level is
# 	"admin", "Limited access" if it is "user", and "No access" if it is "guest".

access_level = input("enter your access level").strip().lower()

if access_level == "admin":
    print("Full access")
elif access_level == "user":
    print("Limited access")
elif access_level == "guest":
    print("No access")
else:
    print("Invalid")


#  13. 	Given a string `email` collected from the user, write an if statement to check if the
# 	email contains both "@" and 	"." characters. Print "Valid email" if it does, otherwise
# 	print "Invalid email".
 
 useremail = input("enter your email address")
if "@" in email and "." in useremailemail:
    print("Valid email")
else:
    print("Invalid email")




#  14. 	You have a variable `day` provided by user input which can be any day of the week 
# 	(e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday", 	etc.). Write an if statement that prints "Weekend" if the
# 	day is "Saturday" or "Sunday", and "Weekday" if it is any other day.
#  15. 	Write a program that takes three numbers (num1, num2, num3) as a comma-separated string 
# 	input from the user and prints the greatest number. Use conditional statements
# 	to determine which number is the greatest. Bonus point if you can do it without `else` 
# 	statements.
