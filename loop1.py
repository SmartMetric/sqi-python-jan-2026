# Print numbers from 1 to 5
# Expected Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# Print "Hello" 3 times
# Expected Output:
# Hello
# Hello
# Hello

# i = 1
# while i <= 5:
#     print(i)
#     i +=1    


# Print only even numbers from 2 to 10 (do not use += 2)
# Expected Output:
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# 10

# steps: 2,4,6,8,10 is to extracted without making +2 was the determining gap.
# %2==0 will give even numbers and it was adopted for the If condition.


# i = 2
# while i <= 10:
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         print(i)
#     i +=1


# Print numbers in reverse from 5 to 1 using a while loop.
# Expected Output:
# 5
# 4
# 3
# 2
# 1

# steps: starting point is 5 and end at 1. the determing gap will be -1. no condition is needed here

# i = 5
# while i >= 1:
#     print(i)
#     i -=1

#  5.	Print numbers from 1 to 10, but skip number 5 - do not use "continue" statement. 
# Expected Output:
